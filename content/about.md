I came from a huble town somewhere in the country of Europe.

I started travelling and hopping to different countries because of my job. A few years here and there.

I encountered a lot questions and things that are new to me like:

* Basic things you need when camping (for camping first timers)
* What to do when bitten by a snake?
* How to pack for a 1 or 2 day out of town trip (camping or in an accommodation / with or without a car)
* Leaving the country you are at (with friends)
* Coming to a new country (to work for a few years)
* Got a plane ticket and leaving the country for good in a few days (With all your stuff at home still in their rightful place as if you were not leaving at all)

I also share some personal stories which I do not even share with any of my friends. Sometimes about normal life stuff, sometimes about love.

Hopefully you learn something or at least get a wee bit entertained.

Kindly contact me if you have ANYTHING to say. I've made it easy via the contact form above.

Enjoy
