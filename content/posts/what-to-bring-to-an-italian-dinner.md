## TL;DR
* Really good quality Olive Oil
* Nice wine

I'm writing this story because this was my first invitation by an Italian friend to her house amongst a bunch of friends.

I did know what to bring that time. According to her, she was going to cook EVERYTHING and therefore, what could you bring?

Questions that arised were:
* Will you go for something safe such as nice *wine*?
* Desserts and will this match the italian food she was about to prepare?
* Other things possible?


Clearly this was the first time I faced this, on my own, in a foreign country so here is what I did:
* Visit your local or online deli and risk it. I basically got:
	* Burrata
		* Turns out she had this already but why not two
	* Olive stuffed sardine rolls
		* From the deli, I did not make them myself of course
	* Red Wine
		* Basic and safe
	* Really nice Olive Oil
		* She liked this one (RECOMMENDED)
	* Yourself

Bringing something is considered basic etiquette but just so you know, she had enough food for an **army**. I'm not sure if it was just her or it was an italian thing.

If you're still unsure, see [this post](https://www.marthastewart.com/7689965/what-guests-should-bring-dinner-party) for general tips on what to bring to dinner.

To summarise, she was so tired from preparing all of that food and happy watching all of us enjoy it that all she needed was a glass(bottle) of wine (and maybe Olive oil for the next thing she's cooking tomorrow).

If you have any other suggestion, feel free to drop me an email.
