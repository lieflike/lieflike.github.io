## TL;DR
* God-like skills to create your own game
* Mastery
* Humbleness

This post means no intention of blasphemy, comparison or to offend anybody. I'll make this short.

I used to be a big gamer which is what got me into tech. At the level of exposure I have to tech and the tech skill sets I've developed, I'd say that I now can create games. So this is what I feel when I play video games:

Its like having the skills and power of a god(a weak god as of the moment but still a god) and visiting and *living* in a world that another god created, as a human/citizen of that world. These other gods are not true gods but were just humans before that made themselves and evolved themselves to be god. So as a god like you see in movies or read in myth stories/folklore, gods and are just too powerful and defeat human armies, but hey that's why they're a god. So it eventually gets boring for a god to play these human games with the mechanics her fellow gods made. Eventually a god stops playing these petty games and do big league stuff and what I mean by this is creating her own world with her own mechanics and her own humans/citizens. Doesn't but would be great for other gods to come down to their world, observe and play.

I hope the above sums up what I feel when I play video games now, just to explain the metaphor in case you don't get it, I have the skill sets of making a game so to play and spend many hours in another game trying to beat that game doesn't really makes sense, given I have the capability to automate, cheat and hack it and not compete with the humans in that world which practice their craft (i.e. in an arena/other crafts).

Also another metaphor is when playing Minecraft or Roblox. How I see a Minecraft/Roblox world/game creator is creating a city and being its own mayor, but still being in a world that a god created.

However, I still play these games, why, because of my kids. They are not gods yet to come up with me up there and remain as a human in a world that the other gods created. Think of it as Zeus making babies with humans and transforming into human form just to spend time with his kids then eventually goes back up to Olympus and watches over them together with the other gods.

That's all I have to share, how I feel when I play games at this moment in my life and why I don't play them *alone* anymore. Eventually I'll be making small worlds. I don't have plans making video games (worlds) but similar tech creations (moons or "satellites" [or death stars :D]) .

P.S. Just to reiterate, I'm not really comparing myself to any god, just used it as a metaphor.
