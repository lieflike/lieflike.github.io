<meta name=description content="I came from a huble town somewhere in the country of Europe.
I started travelling and hopping to different countries because of my job. A few years here and there.
I encountered a lot questions and things that are new to me like:
 Basic things you need when camping (for camping first timers) What to do when bitten by a snake? How to pack for a 1 or 2 day out of town trip (camping or in an accommodation / with or without a car) Leaving the country you are at (with friends) Coming to a new country (to work for a few years) Got a plane ticket and leaving the country for good in a few days (With all your stuff at home still in their rightful place as if you were not leaving at all)  I also share some personal stories which I do not even share with any of my friends.">
